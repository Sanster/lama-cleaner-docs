# Interactive Segmentation

Lama Cleaner integrates a small **interactive segmentation** model(so it can run on CPU) from [ClickSEG](https://github.com/XavierCHEN34/ClickSEG).
This model will use the mouse click position and image as input and output the segmented mask.
User can choice the next click position(positive or negative) based on the output. It's fun and might be useful in many scenarios.

The basic operation process is as follows:

- Click the button on the bottom toolbar(or by shortcut `i`) to toggle `Interactive Segmentation` mode
- Left click(positive) on the image to select things you want to mask
- Right click(negative) on the image to exclude things you don't want to mask
- Click `Accept`
- Complete the mask with the brush (If the result of interactive segmentation is not good)
- Inpainting!
