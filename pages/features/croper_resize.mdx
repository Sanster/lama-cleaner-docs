# Croper

Available for `sd1.5/sd2` and `paint_by_example` models.

When you have a large image, you can use Croper to crop it into smaller image which requires less memory and time to run inpainting.

# Resize

Available for `sd1.5/sd2` and `paint_by_example` models.

Resize the image before inpainting, then scale up the inpainting area to fill the origin area, the area outside the mask will not lose quality. This option can be used to save vRAM.
