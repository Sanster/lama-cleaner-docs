# File Manager

For users who need to process lots of photos, File Manager would be helpful. Users can browse images in
the input/output directory, search images by name, and sort images by create time or file name.
To enable the File Manager, set two command line args when starting Lama Cleaner.

- `--input`: a directory contains images you want to clean up
- `--output-dir`: The directory where you want to save the resulting image when clicking the download button on the web page,
  the resulting image will download to the output directory. **A folder will be created in this directory to store the thumbnails**

A folder icon will appear on the left-top corner, click this icon to open FileManager, or use shortcut `f`.
