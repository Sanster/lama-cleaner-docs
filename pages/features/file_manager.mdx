# File Manager

For users need to process lots of photos and File Manager would be helpful. Users can browser images in both the
image directory and the output directory, search images by name. To enable the File Manager, set two command line args when starting Lama Cleaner.

- `--input`: a directory contains images you want to clean up
- `--output-dir`: The directory where you want to save the resulting image when clicking the download button on the web page,
  the resulting image will download to the output directory. **A folder will be created in this directory to store the thumbnails**

A folder icon will appear on the left-top corner, click this icon to open FileManager, or use shortcut `f`.
