- sd/paint_by_example models: `~/.cache/huggingface/diffusers`. For Windows users, it's `C:\Users\your_name\.cache\huggingface\diffusers`
- lama and other models: `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints`. For Windows users, it's `C:\Users\your_name\.cache\torch\hub\checkpoints`

## How to add command line args to the windows installer?

Double click `win_config.bat`, and you can config all command line args in web UI.

## How to change GPU device to use in windows installer?

## How to completely uninstall lama-cleaner?

### Delete lama-cleaner program

- For windows installer: delete the unzipped folder
- For pip: `pip uninstall lama-cleaner`

### Delete downloaded models:

By default lama-cleaner download model to `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/` or `~/.cache/huggingface/diffusers`(sd/paint_by_example).
For Windows users, it's `C:\Users\your_name\.cache\torch\hub\checkpoints\` or `C:\Users\your_name\.cache\huggingface\diffusers`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The default model cache directory may contain other models, so you should only
  delete the lama-cleaner related models.
</Callout>

If you used `--model-dir=xxxx` to change the model directory, you safely delete the directory you specified.

## Why do I get all black or green results?

- sd1.5/sd2
- paint_by_example

Some GPUs don't support half-precision floating point numbers (a known issue with 16xx cards),
a green or black screen may appear instead of the generated pictures.
This may be fixed by using the command line arguments `--no-half`
