# Download Model Manually

If you have problems downloading the model automatically when lama-cleaner start,
you can download it manually. By default lama-cleaner will load model from `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/` or `~/.cache/huggingface/diffusers`(sd/paint_by_example),
you can change the root cache dir(`~/.cache`) using command line arg `--model-dir=xxxx`.
