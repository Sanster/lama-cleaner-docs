# Models

Lama Cleaner support many AI inpainting models out of the box. These models can be categorized into two groups:

## Erase

The following models can be used to erase objects, persons or text in any picture(except Manga model, it's trained for manga images).
Depending on the model structure, each model has its characteristics.
Most of the time I use the `LaMa` model, and I suggest you try them all to see which one suits your scene.

- [LaMa](models/lama)
- [LDM](models/ldm)
- [ZITS](models/zits)
- [MAT](models/mat)
- [FcF](models/fcf)
- [Manga](models/manga)

## Erase and Replace

- [Stable Diffusion](models/stable_diffusion): replace objects in the picture base on a text description.
- [Paint by Example](models/paint_by_example): use an example image to guide the model to generate similar content on the image.
