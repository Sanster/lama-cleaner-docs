# Plugins

In the post-processing of image cleaning, in addition to erasing, algorithms such as facial repair or super-resolution are often used.
Now you can directly use them in Lama Cleaner. When starting the Lama Cleaner service, you can enable plugins through command line parameters.
And the enabled plugins will be available in the **top-left corner**.

  Most plugins require `torchvision` to be installed, please follow pytorch's
  [get-started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install
  corresponding versions.
