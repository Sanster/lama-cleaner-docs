## Interactive Segmentation

The [Segment Anything Model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) can produce high quality object masks from user click.

Command line argument to enable Interactive Segmentation Plugin:

```bash
--enable-interactive-seg --interactive-seg-model=vit_l  --interactive-seg-device=cuda
```

The basic operation process is as follows:

- Toggle `Interactive Segmentation` mode
- Left click(positive) on the image to select things you want to mask
- Right click(negative) on the image to exclude things you don't want to mask
- Click `Accept`
- Complete the mask with the brush (If the result of interactive segmentation is not good)
- Inpainting!
